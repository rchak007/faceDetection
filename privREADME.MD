## going to synch this to repo - faceDetection

## - conda activate allu #this i the env.

## detectFaces.py is the new

this will detect face from each of the frames

## extractFrames.py -

from video it will create the frames.

Given the advancements in deep learning, models like MTCNN and RetinaFace are highly recommended for their accuracy and robustness in diverse conditions. They outperform traditional methods like Haar Cascades and even Dlib's HOG-based detector, especially in complex scenarios.

Implementing MTCNN in Python:

detectFacesOld1 - is older one which did not perform well
faced_old - folder has faces from this program.
