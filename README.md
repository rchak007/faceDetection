# Face Detection MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks)

This repository contains two Python scripts for extracting frames from videos and detecting faces in those frames using MTCNN.

## Overview

1. **`extractFrames.py`**: Extracts frames from video files at a specified interval.
2. **`detectFaces.py`**: Detects faces in extracted frames and saves cropped face images.

## Requirements

Ensure you have Python installed and the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python mtcnn numpy
```



## Usage

### 1. Extract Frames from Videos

Place your video files in a directory named `dataset/`, then run:

```
bash


CopyEdit
python extractFrames.py
```

- Extracted frames will be saved in `frames/` under subdirectories named after the video files.
- By default, frames are extracted every 30 frames.

### 2. Detect Faces in Frames

After extracting frames, detect faces by running:

```
bash


CopyEdit
python detectFaces.py
```

- It scans `frames/` for images and detects faces using MTCNN.
- Cropped face images are saved in `faces/` under subdirectories corresponding to the video files.

## Folder Structure

```
bashCopyEdit/repo_root
â”‚â”€â”€ dataset/         # Place video files here
â”‚â”€â”€ frames/          # Extracted frames are stored here
â”‚â”€â”€ faces/           # Cropped face images are saved here
â”‚â”€â”€ extractFrames.py # Script to extract frames from videos
â”‚â”€â”€ detectFaces.py   # Script to detect faces in extracted frames
â”‚â”€â”€ README.md        # Project documentation
```

## Customization

- Change the 

  frame extraction interval

   in 

  ```
  extractFrames.py
  ```

  :

  ```
  python
  
  
  CopyEdit
  extract_frames(video_path, video_output, interval=30)
  ```

- Adjust the **face detection model** in `detectFaces.py` if needed.

## Notes

- Ensure `dataset/` exists and contains video files before running `extractFrames.py`.
- `detectFaces.py` expects `frames/` to be populated before running.
